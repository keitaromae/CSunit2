  Today in ComSci class, we had some revision test. To be honest, I wasnt able to solve even one of the problem in right way.
  I should start spending more time on computer science. After that, we used arduino to express the count from 0-15 in binery.
  Since we are not familiar with started arduino that much, it is always stressful and challenging for me to first digest, and 
  start working on it.
