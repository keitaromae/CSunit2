  Today in ComSci class, we had some revision test. To be honest, I wasnt able to solve even one of the problem in right way.
  I should start spending more time on computer science. After that, we used arduino to express the count from 0-15 in binery.
  Since we are not familiar with started arduino that much, it is always stressful and challenging for me to first digest, and 
  start working on it.

  I've learn several techniques to convert decimals to binary code. From my first glance, they were all a bit complicated and
  hard to understand, but continueing practice it will be fine. Also we learned logic gates. It helped me to understand the 
  concept from different perspective.
